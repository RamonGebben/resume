        "summary": "I am a 24 years young passionate front-end developer using HTML(5), CSS(Next)/SCSS/LESS/PostCSS, JavaScript(ESNext, Coffee and Vanilla, TypeScript), and Node.js for backend. In my free time I maintain a website called Daily-Javascript.com, where I mention a new libraries or major changes in the JavaScript community. Besides that I love building on API's with frameworks such as Hapi.js, Koa, Express and just plain Node. When building web application with user interfaces my weapon of choice is React, but I also had a lot of fun with Riot and Vue. I am looking for a job at an amazing company where we can work with bleeding edge technologies and where we can contribute on pushing Javascript and the web to the next level. Furthermore I like to learn more about functional programming, since I'm noticing that this is the easiest way to make scalable and predictable applications. So a company that would embrace these principles would be an amazing environment for me to become a better developer.",

This was a hybrid app. I came into this in the proof of concept phase the project and it will be in the app store's soon. For this project we wrote our own framework on top of Cordova. In order to keep the performance as best as we could we needed to minimize the usage of libraries and optimize every bit of JavaScript. My responsibilities in this project very diverse. From styling to continuous integration. The styling we did with LESS. The naming conventions of classes where very similar to those of BEM but not strongly enforced. For the continuous integration we are using Jenkins together with a custom web hook proxy for handling merges and releases. As a task runner we used gulp and some custom build scripts to handle the native part.",
